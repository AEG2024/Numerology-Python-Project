My Numerology Project Read Me File

My project consists of building a numerology GUI that takes your name and birthday and turns it into a numerology report of a person’s: Life path number, their expression number, soul urge number, and their personality number. After they reveal their (4) numbers, there is a brief description that pairs along with each number to give a more rounded explanation of what is the meaning behind the number that they generated. It is designed to be simple, straightforward, and easy to understand. It is python code. I may add more to it when I have the time to make it have some exceptions for input errors, but I think for now that it will work well, when used as intended. I created a more colorful and whimsical GUI to add to the ‘mystical arts’ effect.  I used Visual Studio Code and tkinter to generate the code.
