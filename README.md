Numerology Read Me File

My project consists of building a numerology GUI that takes your full name and birthday, and turns it into a numerology report of a person’s: Life path number, their expression number, soul urge number, and their personality number. After they reveal their (4) numbers, there is a brief description that pairs along with each number to give a more detailed explanation of what is the meaning behind the number that they generated. It is designed to be simple, straightforward, and easy to understand. It is written in python code. I created a more colorful and whimsical GUI to add to the ‘mystical arts’ effect.  I used Visual Studio Code and tkinter to generate the code, and added black for PEP8 compliance. The font has been made larger and the window boxes have been made larger to accomodate the larger text and more information.
